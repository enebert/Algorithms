# Algorithms
##Summer 2022 Project

This summer I am working through *Introduction to Algorithms* by Cormen, Leiserson, Rivest, \& Stein. Please see the wiki regarding progress and what I hope to get through. Be forewarned, when I write goals, there is far more written down than can be gone through in the available time-frame.
