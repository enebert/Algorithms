# Algorithms
##Summer 2022 Project 

This summer I am working through *Introduction to Algorithms* by Cormen, Leiserson, Rivest, \& Stein. Please see the wiki regarding progress and what I hope to get through. Be forewarned, when I write goals, there is far more written down than can be gone through in the available time-frame.

I began with a handful of problems regarding the Fibonacci sequence defined in the following way:

$$
f_n = \begin{cases}
  0 &\text{ if } n = 0 \\
  1 &\text{ if } n = 1  \\
  f_{n-1} + f_{n-2} &\text{ otherwise} \\
\end{cases}
$$
