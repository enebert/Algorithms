# Algorithms
## Summer 2022 Project

This summer I am working through *Introduction to Algorithms* by Cormen, Leiserson, Rivest, \& Stein. Please see the wiki regarding progress and what I hope to get through. I took some time off for the July 4 weekend and am finishing up with graphing algorithms.
